@back BadEnd

The city lies in darkness, only occasionally illuminated by the distant flashes of artillery fire. Ardan walks carefully, his mother Mira and young sister Naya trailing close behind, shadows amidst the ruin. Rejected by the sanctuary and left to fend for themselves, they trudge through the empty streets, each step laden with exhaustion, uncertainty, and the grim realization that they are truly alone.

@back BuildingRuin

As dawn approaches, they find shelter in the remnants of an abandoned building, its walls crumbling and windows shattered, offering scant protection from the cold. Ardan gently lowers Naya onto a pile of old blankets, trying to shield her from the chill that seeps through the broken walls. Mira, pale and visibly weakened, sinks against the wall beside them, her breaths shallow and labored.

@char Naya.Sad

Naya: Why didn’t they let us stay, Ardan?

Ardan crouches beside her, forcing a faint smile as he tries to comfort her, though his own heart is weighed down by despair.

@char Ardan.DefaultA

Ardan: Sometimes… people remember the things we’ve done, even the choices we wish we could take back. What Dad and I did… it made them afraid of us.

@char Ardan.PensiveA

@char Mira.Depressed

Naya nods, but her expression remains uncertain, reflecting the fear that has taken root in all of them. Ardan glances over at Mira, who watches him with a mixture of pride and sorrow, knowing that her illness is worsening and aware of the burden her children now carry.

She reaches into her coat pocket and pulls out a small, tarnished locket—an heirloom from their past life—and presses it into Ardan’s hand.

Mira: This… belonged to your father. He gave it to me before all of this. Keep it close, Ardan… a reminder of what we’re holding on to.

Ardan looks down at the locket, its surface scratched and worn but still bearing a faint engraving. As he clutches it, he feels the weight of the responsibility he now carries - not only for survival but for honoring the memory of his father and protecting what remains of his family. He nods, his expression grim, but Mira can see the faint glimmer of hope fading in his eyes.

@char Ardan.ConflictedA

Ardan: I’ll keep us safe, Mom. Somehow.

@char Mira.Happy

Mira tries to smile, but her face is etched with pain, and a violent cough wracks her body. 

@char Mira.Conflicted
She looks away, perhaps knowing but unwilling to say that she may not survive much longer. Ardan clenches his jaw, determined but painfully aware of how thin his own strength is stretched.

Outside, the ominous sounds of war grow louder, and Ardan glances back at the shattered doorway, gripping a broken metal rod he’s carried as a makeshift weapon. He knows it would do little against any real threat, but it’s all he has. He steps in front of Mira and Naya, shielding them as best as he can.

@char Naya.Conflicted

Naya: Will we be okay, Ardan?

@char Ardan.DefaultA

Ardan forces another smile, his gaze drifting back to the locket in his hand.

Ardan: As long as we’re together... we’ll keep going.

Naya tries to believe him, clinging to his side, but her eyes dart around the empty, cold room. Mira’s breathing grows more labored, and a dark shadow of worry crosses Ardan’s face as he watches her, knowing he is powerless to help.

Mira: Ardan... if anything happens… you must keep going, for Naya. Promise me...

Ardan can barely meet her gaze, but he nods, his hand tightening around the locket as if it could somehow offer them salvation.

@char Ardan pos:50

Mira’s eyes close, her face peaceful but exhausted, and Ardan is left to sit in the silence, the sounds of distant conflict echoing through the shattered walls.

@char Ardan.ExhaustedA

As he watches over his mother and sister, Ardan feels the weight of despair pressing down on him. The hope he once clung to has faded, and all that remains is the grim knowledge that survival may be a hollow promise. He realizes now that the world they knew is gone, and all that’s left is the struggle to make it through one more night.

THE END THANKS FOR PLAYING!!!
