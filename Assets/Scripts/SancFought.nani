As he finishes speaking, a familiar voice rings out from across the room, sharp and bitter.

Man: Wait… I know you.

Ardan’s heart sinks. Standing across the room is the other father from the pharmacy, his young son at his side. The man’s face is etched with lines of exhaustion, his eyes filled with a mix of resentment and pain.

Mira: Ardan… is this…?

Ardan’s mind races with memories of the pharmacy—the desperation, the choice he made to take the antibiotics. Before he can respond, the other father steps forward, his voice tight with bitterness.

Man: You stole the last of those antibiotics from us! My boy… he got worse after that. We nearly lost him!

His accusations hang heavy in the air, and soon all eyes in the sanctuary are on Ardan and his family. Mira’s face pales, her eyes wide with fear and guilt. Naya clutches her mother’s hand, her gaze darting around the room.

Man: You and your father beat me badly, took what was ours. You think you can just walk in here and expect forgiveness?

Mira’s face falls, her expression filled with remorse as she realizes the cost of her survival. She pushes herself to her feet, her movements slow and deliberate, and meets the other father’s gaze.

Mira: Wait! They were only trying to save me! We didn’t know… we didn’t mean to hurt anyone.

Man: Save you? At what cost? My son’s life? Your boy here beat me to the ground, took what he wanted. You think that’s right?

Ardan: No… no, it’s not right. But we had no choice. We had to try… to save her. What would you have done if that was your wife!? Your mother!?

Ardan: We did what we had to do to survive. If you were in my place, you’d do the same. You can’t blame me for wanting to protect my family.

The other father’s expression falters for a moment, his bitterness wavering as he tightens his grip on his son’s shoulder. He looks down at the boy, his face etched with the burden of responsibility.

Man: I lost my wife early in this war. It’s just been me and him ever since. Every time he gets sick, I… I don’t know if he’ll make it. And then you took what he needed most.

A flash of guilt crosses his face, and he hesitates before continuing, his voice softer.

Man: I know what it’s like to make hard choices. I’ve done things I regret too… things I wish I could undo. But for him, I’d do it all over again.

Man: That still doesn’t make it right. You took what was ours, and you can’t just walk away from that.

Ardan watches the man, a knot forming in his stomach. He thinks of his own father, Dorin, and wonders if he’s truly honoring his memory with the choices he’s made. The weight of Dorin’s expectations and his own guilt press down on him, and for a moment, he’s unsure if he deserves this sanctuary.

; CHOICES HERE

; Option A: Apologise

Ardan: “You’re right. We were desperate, but that doesn’t make what we did any less painful for you. I’m sorry. If there’s a way to make it up, we’ll try.”
Outcome: The other father’s expression softens slightly, though his eyes remain guarded. Ardan feels Mira’s hand on his arm, her relief palpable. Naya watches her father with quiet admiration, sensing his sincerity. Some community members regard Ardan with tentative empathy, and the tension in the room eases slightly.

; Option B: Justification for Survival

Ardan: I'll say it again. We did what we had to do to survive. If you were in my place, you’d do the same. You can’t blame me for wanting to protect my family.

Outcome: The other father’s anger deepens, and he glares at Ardan, his face hardening. Mira’s face shows disappointment, her gaze filled with worry as she glances at the others. Naya looks up at Ardan with confusion, sensing the tension. Community members exchange uneasy glances, some whispering in distrust. Ardan’s family is allowed to stay, but he senses the growing wariness around them.

; Option C: Attempt at Reconciliation

Ardan: “I know it wasn’t fair to you, but I can’t change the past. All I can do is try to make things right, now and going forward. I want to help.”

Outcome: The other father hesitates, his resentment mixed with reluctant understanding. Mira gives Ardan an encouraging nod, her face a mixture of guilt and gratitude. Naya watches her father with tentative trust. This balanced response wins cautious acceptance from the community, with access to limited resources and an opportunity to earn their trust.
