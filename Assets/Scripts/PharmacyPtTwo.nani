The pharmacy is deathly quiet, with only the sound of broken glass crunching underfoot. Long shadows stretch across the room from the pale moonlight streaming in through a broken window. Dorin and Ardan move cautiously, their footsteps deliberate as they scan the rows of empty shelves.
Dorin picks up an empty pill bottle and turns it over in his hands, the weight of desperation sinking deeper into his chest. Ardan pushes aside discarded packaging and debris as they search for any remaining medical supplies.

Ardan: *He is frustrated, kicking a box aside.*
Ardan: There's nothing here. Someone must’ve cleared this place out weeks ago.

Dorin checks the label on a half-crushed box of bandages, his brow furrowed in disappointment. He lets it fall to the floor.

Dorin: *He mutters, voice heavy with concern.*
Dorin: "We should’ve expected this. Every place like this was picked clean in the first days."

Ardan shakes his head.

Ardan: "Not even scraps. What now?"

; ----------- SCAVENGING OPPORTUNITIES - PLAYER CHOICES HERE -----------

You have three options to choose from. Select wisely, as your choice will determine the family's next steps.

# Option 1: Search Front Aisles

The two decide to check the Front Aisles.

Dorin: We'll check the front aisles some more. Maybe there's something we missed.

They move through the front aisles, the shelves barren except for broken packaging and the remnants of what once filled the store. 
Ardan kneels to sift through a pile of debris, picking up an empty box of antiseptic wipes.

Ardan: *He sighs, frustration evident in his voice.*

# Option 2: Check Back Storage Room

The two decide to check Back Storage Room.

Dorin: "We move to the back. Someone might have overlooked the storage rooms over there."

They push further into the pharmacy, stepping over more shattered glass and broken containers. As they reach the employee storage room, Dorin cautiously pushes open the door. The space is dim, cluttered with empty boxes and broken shelves. Ardan spots something beneath the rubble.

Ardan: *Calling out, his voice low but urgent.*
Ardan: Dad, over here.

Dorin crouches beside his son, helping to brush away fragments of glass and debris. Among the mess, a small object gleams faintly in the moonlight—a box cutter, its blade dull but intact. Dorin picks it up and inspects it, testing the retractable blade.

Dorin: *His voice is quiet & grim.*
Dorin: It’s not much, but it’ll do.

Ardan watches as Dorin pockets the tool, knowing what it means. This isn’t just a tool for cutting — it could be a weapon if it came down to it. The weight of that realization hangs between them.

Ardan wearily looks to his father, his voice low.

Ardan: "Do you think we’ll need to use it?"

Dorin meets his son’s gaze, his expression hardening as he considers the question.

Dorin: If we have to. Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.

# Option 3: Check Back Aisles

The two decide to check Back Aisles of the Pharmacy.

Dorin: We’ll try the back aisles. Maybe there’s something left behind.

They continue through the pharmacy, moving to the back aisles where a collapsed shelving unit blocks their path. Dorin pauses, noticing a glimpse of red beneath a pile of broken packaging.

Dorin nods toward the debris.
Dorin: "Give me a hand."

Together, they lift a fallen beam, clearing away the wreckage to reveal a dusty medkit, half-buried under the mess. Dorin opens it, revealing gauze, bandages, and a few basic medical tools.

A mix of frustration and relief brims in Dorin's voice as he inspects the contents.

Dorin: "It’s not what we came for, but we can use this."

Ardan leans in to look at the contents of the medkit, his expression thoughtful.

Ardan: "Maybe we can trade it. Someone else might need it as badly as we need antibiotics."

Dorin nods, weighing the possibility. It’s not much, but in a world this broken, even bandages could be worth something.

Dorin: "Yeah. It could be our bargaining chip."

With the medkit in hand, they press on, their search taking on a new urgency. The faint hope of finding something worthwhile pushes them deeper into the pharmacy, but the weight of desperation hangs over every step.

Suddenly, a loud crash echoes through the pharmacy, shattering the silence. Dorin and Ardan freeze, their eyes meeting in shared alarm.
