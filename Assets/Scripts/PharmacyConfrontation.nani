They round the corner, only to find themselves face-to-face with another father and son. The two groups freeze, the air thick with tension. 
Both families look gaunt, desperate, the hollow eyes of hunger and fear staring back at each other. The other father clutches a small bag, the outline of medicine bottles visible.
It seems they had gotten here first, luckier or more desperate than Dorin and Ardan. 
Dorin’s eyes immediately lock onto one of them — antibiotics. The very thing they came for.

For a long moment, no one speaks. The two fathers size each other up, the unspoken threat hanging between them. Ardan’s hand inches toward the box cutter in his pocket, but Dorin raises a hand, silently telling him to wait.

Ardan's voice is barely above a whisper, tense.
Ardan: Dad... that’s it. That’s what we need.

Dorin doesn’t take his eyes off the other father, whose injured body is trembling slightly. Blood seeps through old bandages wrapped around his arms and legs, but despite his weakened state, he stands tall. 
His son, barely a teen, clings to his side, eyes wide with fear. Dorin knows in his heart that they’re just like him and Ardan — fighting for survival, for someone they love.

The other father’s voice cuts through the silence, low and hoarse.

The stranger's voice is weary, but defiant.
Other Father: I don’t know what you think you’re gonna do... but we need this medicine. Don’t make me fight for it.

Dorin clenches his jaw, feeling the weight of the decision pressing down on him. The antibiotics in that bag could save Mira. Without them, she won’t make it. 
He glances at Ardan, whose face is a mix of hope and fear. 
But if they take it, if they use force, this other family... they might not survive either.

The silence stretches, the tension palpable. Dorin has a choice to make.

; ----------- CHOICE 1 - FIGHT, TAKE BY FORCE -----------
