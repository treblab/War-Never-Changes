Ardan’s gaze catches on a familiar face. The other father from the pharmacy stands across the room, his young son beside him. Recognition flickers in the man’s eyes, and a tense silence falls between them as he approaches, his expression unreadable.

The man pauses, then nods at Ardan, a hint of forced politeness in his voice.

Man: You’re the ones from the pharmacy… tried to bargain with me for the antibiotics.

Ardan stiffens, feeling Mira’s curious gaze on him as he faces the man. Memories of that day resurface—the plea he and Dorin had made, the hope that maybe, somehow, they could come to an agreement. But the man had refused, choosing to hold on to the medicine despite Ardan’s family’s clear need. A flicker of bitterness flashes in Ardan’s eyes, though he keeps his tone even.

ARDAN: “Yes. We offered what we had, but you turned us down. So we walked away.”

The other father shifts uncomfortably, glancing at his son, who watches Ardan with curious, wary eyes. He clears his throat, trying to soften his voice.

Man: I did what I had to for my family. Just like you would.

Ardan’s jaw tightens, a slight bitterness slipping into his voice despite his efforts to remain composed.

ARDAN: We did what I had to, too. I walked away. Not everyone would have.

A tense silence stretches between them, charged with unspoken frustration. The other father’s expression hardens slightly, but he quickly masks it, as though unwilling to admit he might have misjudged Ardan’s family. 

Man: Your dad... he’s not with you?

Before either of them can speak further, the community leader—a sharp-eyed woman who has been watching from a distance—steps between them, her tone brisk and authoritative.

Leader: You two know each other?

The other father hesitates, then gives a stiff nod.

Man: Our paths crossed. They… had the chance to do something different. Chose not to.

The leader looks between them, raising an eyebrow, clearly noting the tension.

Leader: Well, whatever’s in the past stays there. Sanctuary’s a shared space, and resources are tight. If either of you has a problem, best sort it out now. We don’t have room for grudges.

The man nods, glancing back at Ardan, his expression a mix of respect and guardedness. He takes a deep breath, clearly uncomfortable with the conversation but aware of the need to address it.

Man: Look… I know you’re bitter about what happened. But we’re all just trying to get by. Maybe it’s time we put that day behind us.

Ardan meets his gaze, the bitterness simmering just beneath the surface. He knows he needs to stay composed for Mira and Naya’s sake, but the frustration of that day still lingers, a reminder of how scarce kindness has become.

Ardan: My father's dead. We're all trying to survive. And we've learned what survival costs.

The other father flinches slightly, sensing the edge in Ardan’s words, but he doesn’t press the matter. Instead, he shifts, as though wrestling with his own thoughts, before speaking again, his tone more measured.

Man: If we’re both here, maybe we can find a way to help each other this time. I’ll be out on the next supply run. We could cover more ground… work together.

Ardan studies him for a moment, weighing the offer, his mind racing with conflicting emotions. He feels the bitterness still clinging to him, but he knows that he and his family can’t afford to be reckless. The sanctuary is a fragile haven, and pragmatism must outweigh resentment.

; Choices here

; Reluctantly Accept the Offer

Ardan: (with a tight nod) Fine. I’ll watch your back, you watch mine. But let’s keep it simple.

Outcome: The other father nods, understanding the wariness in Ardan’s tone. On the next supply run, Ardan can count on the man to have his back, while keeping interactions minimal but effective. This cooperation builds a wary respect, but the bitterness still lingers.

; Express Bitterness, but Agree to Work Together

Ardan: (coldly) I’ll help, but don’t think I’ve forgotten what happened. My family comes first.

Outcome: The other father nods stiffly, understanding the warning in Ardan’s tone. The bitterness remains, though both families sense the benefit of occasional cooperation.

; Refuse, Choosing Independence

Ardan: I think we’ll handle things on our own. We’ve done fine so far.

Outcome: The other father shrugs, respecting Ardan’s decision but remaining wary. Ardan’s family maintains their independence, but the tension between them and the other father’s family remains.
