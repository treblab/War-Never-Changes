# Introduction - At Apartment

The room is dim, lit only by the faint glow of a cracked window. Mira lies on a makeshift bed, her skin pale and covered in a sheen of sweat. Naya, sitting quietly by her mother’s side, holds her hand, worry etched across her young face. 
Ardan paces near the doorway, glancing between his mother and father. Dorin stands still, his fists clenched, watching Mira's labored breathing. The silence is thick, broken only by the distant sounds of war outside.

Naya: *She's whispering, stroking Mira's hand.*
Naya: Is Mama going to be okay, Dad?

@char Dorin

Dorin: *Dorin’s face tightens, and he looks at his daughter, forcing himself to meet her gaze.*
Dorin: *He crouches beside Naya, brushing her hair behind her ear gently.*
Dorin: We're going to do everything we can, Naya. We just need to find some antibiotics to help her fight off the infection.

*Naya’s eyes are wide, searching for reassurance, but Dorin quickly stands before his resolve falters. He nods at Ardan, and the two step away from Mira’s bedside to speak in hushed tones.*

@char Ardan

Ardan: *His voice is tense, strained.* 
Ardan: She's getting worse, Dad. We need to find those antibiotics fast. Ardan meets his father’s gaze, anger flaring for a moment before he nods. He exhales slowly, trying to calm himself.

Ardan: *He is calmer, but resolute.*
Ardan: Yeah. I’m ready.

@char Mira

*Dorin walks back to Mira, kneeling beside her. Her eyes flutter open, hazy with fever. She struggles to focus on his face*.
Mira: *Her voice is weak, and she barely manages a whisper.*
Mira: Dorin... Ardan... don’t... don’t go...

*Dorin takes her hand, squeezing gently.*

Dorin: *His voice soft but determined.*
Dorin: We have to, Mira. We don’t have a choice.

Mira shakes her head weakly, tears pooling in her eyes.

Mira: It’s too dangerous... I don’t want... to lose you too.

Dorin leans in closer.

Dorin: You won’t lose us. I’ll bring back what you need. I swear.

Mira closes her eyes, too weak to argue anymore. Dorin stands, turning to Ardan.

Dorin: Get your things. We leave in five minutes.

As Ardan heads to gather supplies, Naya steps forward, her voice trembling.

@char Naya
Naya: *Her voice trembling.*
Naya: Dad, I want to come with you. Please... I can help.

Dorin kneels again, placing a hand on her shoulder.

Dorin: Naya, I need you here. Your mother needs you. Stay with her. Keep her strong for us, okay?

Naya’s eyes well up, but she nods, swallowing back her fear. She hugs him tightly, and Dorin holds her for a moment longer than usual.

Naya: *She clings to him, her voice barely a whisper.*
Naya: Come back... Please come back.

Dorin: *His voice barely holds together.*
Dorin: I will.

@char Ardan

He pulls away and glances one last time at Mira. He exchanges a look with Ardan as they both grab their bags. The apartment feels colder as they step toward the door.

Ardan: *He quietly whispers to his father as they leave.*
Ardan: We’ll find it, Dad. We have to.

Dorin: *He grimly nods.*
Dorin: We will.

The door creaks as it shuts behind them, leaving behind the family, the uncertainty, and the suffocating weight of what they’re fighting to hold onto. They step out into the night, the city’s shadows swallowing them whole.
