# Introduction - At Apartment

The room is dim, lit only by the faint glow of a cracked window. Mira lies on a makeshift bed, her skin pale and covered in a sheen of sweat. 

Ardan paces near the doorway, glancing between his mother and father. Dorin stands still, his fists clenched, watching Mira's labored breathing. 

The silence is thick, broken only by the distant sounds of war outside.

Naya is whimpering, stroking her mother’s hand.

Naya: Is Mama going to be okay, Dad?

*He crouches beside Naya, brushing her hair behind her ear gently.*

Dorin: We're going to do everything we can, Naya. We just need to find some antibiotics to help her fight off the infection.

Naya’s eyes are wide, searching for reassurance, but Dorin quickly stands before his resolve falters. 

He nods at Ardan, and the two step away from Mira’s bedside to speak in hushed tones.

@char Ardan

Ardan: She's getting worse, Dad. We need to find those antibiotics fast. 

Dorin: I know. We'll head to the pharmacy tonight. It's risky, but we don't have a choice.

@char Ardan.Angry

Ardan meets his father’s gaze, anger flaring for a moment before he nods. 

@char Ardan.Conflicted

He exhales slowly, trying to calm himself.

Ardan: Yeah. I’m ready.

@char Mira

*Dorin walks back to Mira, kneeling beside her. Her eyes flutter open, hazy with fever. She struggles to focus on his face*.

Mira: Dorin... Ardan... don’t... don’t go...

*Dorin takes her hand, squeezing gently.*

@char Dorin.Conflicted

Dorin: We have to, Mira. We don’t have a choice.

Mira shakes her head weakly, tears pooling in her eyes.

Mira: It’s too dangerous... I don’t want... to lose you too.

Dorin leans in closer.

@char Dorin.Happy

Dorin: You won’t lose us. I’ll bring back what you need. I swear.

Mira closes her eyes, too weak to argue anymore. Dorin stands, turning to Ardan.

Dorin: Get ready. We leave tonight.

As Ardan heads to gather supplies, Naya steps forward, her voice trembling.

Naya: Dad, I want to come with you. Please... I can help.

Dorin kneels again, placing a hand on her shoulder.

@char Dorin.Happy

Dorin: Naya, I need you here. Your mother needs you. Stay with her. Keep her strong for us, okay?

@char Naya.Sad
Naya’s eyes well up, but she nods, swallowing back her fear. She hugs him tightly, and Dorin holds her for a moment longer than usual.

Naya: Come back... Please come back.

@char Dorin.Default

Dorin: I will.

@hide Naya

@char Ardan

He pulls away and glances one last time at Mira. He exchanges a look with Ardan as they both grab their bags. 

The apartment feels colder as they step toward the door.

Ardan: We’ll find it, Dad. We have to.

Dorin: *He grimly nods.*

Dorin: We will.

The door creaks as it shuts behind them, leaving behind the family, the uncertainty, and the suffocating weight of what they’re fighting to hold onto. They step out into the night, the city’s shadows swallowing them whole.
