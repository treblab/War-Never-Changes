# Introduction - At Apartment
@bgm PharmacyBGM loop:true
@back Apartment
The room is dim, lit only by the faint glow of a cracked window. Mira lies on a makeshift bed, her skin pale and covered in a sheen of sweat. Naya, sitting quietly by her mother’s side, holds her hand, worry etched across her young face. 
Ardan paces near the doorway, glancing between his mother and father. Dorin stands still, his fists clenched, watching Mira's labored breathing. The silence is thick, broken only by the distant sounds of war outside.

Naya: *She's whispering, stroking Mira's hand.*
Naya: Is Mama going to be okay, Dad?

@char Dorin

Dorin: *Dorin’s face tightens, and he looks at his daughter, forcing himself to meet her gaze.*
Dorin: *He crouches beside Naya, brushing her hair behind her ear gently.*
Dorin: We're going to do everything we can, Naya. We just need to find some antibiotics to help her fight off the infection.

*Naya’s eyes are wide, searching for reassurance, but Dorin quickly stands before his resolve falters. He nods at Ardan, and the two step away from Mira’s bedside to speak in hushed tones.*

@char Ardan

Ardan: *His voice is tense, strained.* 
Ardan: She's getting worse, Dad. We need to find those antibiotics fast. Ardan meets his father’s gaze, anger flaring for a moment before he nods. He exhales slowly, trying to calm himself.

Ardan: *He is calmer, but resolute.*
Ardan: Yeah. I’m ready.

@char Mira

*Dorin walks back to Mira, kneeling beside her. Her eyes flutter open, hazy with fever. She struggles to focus on his face*.
Mira: *Her voice is weak, and she barely manages a whisper.*
Mira: Dorin... Ardan... don’t... don’t go...

*Dorin takes her hand, squeezing gently.*

Dorin: *His voice soft but determined.*
Dorin: We have to, Mira. We don’t have a choice.

Mira shakes her head weakly, tears pooling in her eyes.

Mira: It’s too dangerous... I don’t want... to lose you too.

Dorin leans in closer.

Dorin: You won’t lose us. I’ll bring back what you need. I swear.

Mira closes her eyes, too weak to argue anymore. Dorin stands, turning to Ardan.

@char Ardan

Dorin: Get your things. We leave in five minutes.

As Ardan heads to gather supplies, Naya steps forward, her voice trembling.

@hide Ardan

@char Naya
Naya: *Her voice trembling.*
Naya: Dad, I want to come with you. Please... I can help.

Dorin kneels again, placing a hand on her shoulder.

Dorin: Naya, I need you here. Your mother needs you. Stay with her. Keep her strong for us, okay?

Naya’s eyes well up, but she nods, swallowing back her fear. She hugs him tightly, and Dorin holds her for a moment longer than usual.

Naya: *She clings to him, her voice barely a whisper.*
Naya: Come back... Please come back.

Dorin: *His voice barely holds together.*
Dorin: I will.

@hide Naya

@char Ardan

He pulls away and glances one last time at Mira. He exchanges a look with Ardan as they both grab their bags. The apartment feels colder as they step toward the door.

Ardan: *He quietly whispers to his father as they leave.*
Ardan: We’ll find it, Dad. We have to.

Dorin: *He grimly nods.*
Dorin: We will.

The door creaks as it shuts behind them, leaving behind the family, the uncertainty, and the suffocating weight of what they’re fighting to hold onto. They step out into the night, the city’s shadows swallowing them whole.

# Pharmacy
@back Pharmacy
The pharmacy is deathly quiet, with only the sound of broken glass crunching underfoot. Long shadows stretch across the room from the pale moonlight streaming in through a broken window. Dorin and Ardan move cautiously, their footsteps deliberate as they scan the rows of empty shelves.
Dorin picks up an empty pill bottle and turns it over in his hands, the weight of desperation sinking deeper into his chest. Ardan pushes aside discarded packaging and debris as they search for any remaining medical supplies.

Ardan: *He is frustrated, kicking a box aside.*
Ardan: There's nothing here. Someone must’ve cleared this place out weeks ago.

Dorin checks the label on a half-crushed box of bandages, his brow furrowed in disappointment. He lets it fall to the floor.

Dorin: *He mutters, voice heavy with concern.*
Dorin: "We should’ve expected this. Every place like this was picked clean in the first days."

Ardan shakes his head.

Ardan: "Not even scraps. What now?"

; ----------- SCAVENGING OPPORTUNITIES - PLAYER CHOICES HERE -----------

You have three options to choose from. Select wisely, as your choice will determine the family's next steps.

# Option 1: Search Front Aisles

The two decide to check the Front Aisles.

Dorin: We'll check the front aisles some more. Maybe there's something we missed.

They move through the front aisles, the shelves barren except for broken packaging and the remnants of what once filled the store. 
Ardan kneels to sift through a pile of debris, picking up an empty box of antiseptic wipes.

Ardan: *He sighs, frustration evident in his voice.*

# Option 2: Check Back Storage Room

The two decide to check Back Storage Room.

Dorin: "We move to the back. Someone might have overlooked the storage rooms over there."

They push further into the pharmacy, stepping over more shattered glass and broken containers. As they reach the employee storage room, Dorin cautiously pushes open the door. The space is dim, cluttered with empty boxes and broken shelves. Ardan spots something beneath the rubble.

Ardan: *Calling out, his voice low but urgent.*
Ardan: Dad, over here.

Dorin crouches beside his son, helping to brush away fragments of glass and debris. Among the mess, a small object gleams faintly in the moonlight—a box cutter, its blade dull but intact. Dorin picks it up and inspects it, testing the retractable blade.

Dorin: *His voice is quiet & grim.*
Dorin: It’s not much, but it’ll do.

Ardan watches as Dorin pockets the tool, knowing what it means. This isn’t just a tool for cutting — it could be a weapon if it came down to it. The weight of that realization hangs between them.

Ardan wearily looks to his father, his voice low.

Ardan: "Do you think we’ll need to use it?"

Dorin meets his son’s gaze, his expression hardening as he considers the question.

Dorin: If we have to. Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.

# Option 3: Check Back Aisles

The two decide to check Back Aisles of the Pharmacy.

Dorin: We’ll try the back aisles. Maybe there’s something left behind.

They continue through the pharmacy, moving to the back aisles where a collapsed shelving unit blocks their path. Dorin pauses, noticing a glimpse of red beneath a pile of broken packaging.

Dorin nods toward the debris.
Dorin: "Give me a hand."

Together, they lift a fallen beam, clearing away the wreckage to reveal a dusty medkit, half-buried under the mess. Dorin opens it, revealing gauze, bandages, and a few basic medical tools.

A mix of frustration and relief brims in Dorin's voice as he inspects the contents.

Dorin: "It’s not what we came for, but we can use this."

Ardan leans in to look at the contents of the medkit, his expression thoughtful.

Ardan: "Maybe we can trade it. Someone else might need it as badly as we need antibiotics."

Dorin nods, weighing the possibility. It’s not much, but in a world this broken, even bandages could be worth something.

Dorin: "Yeah. It could be our bargaining chip."

With the medkit in hand, they press on, their search taking on a new urgency. The faint hope of finding something worthwhile pushes them deeper into the pharmacy, but the weight of desperation hangs over every step.

# Confrontation
Suddenly, a loud crash echoes through the pharmacy, shattering the silence. Dorin and Ardan freeze, their eyes meeting in shared alarm.
Dorin and Ardan move cautiously toward the noise they just heard.
