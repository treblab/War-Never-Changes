# Introduction - At Apartment

@back Apartment
The room is dim, lit only by the faint glow of a cracked window. Mira lies on a makeshift bed, her skin pale and covered in a sheen of sweat. Naya, sitting quietly by her mother’s side, holds her hand, worry etched across her young face. 
Ardan paces near the doorway, glancing between his mother and father. Dorin stands still, his fists clenched, watching Mira's labored breathing. The silence is thick, broken only by the distant sounds of war outside.

# Pharmacy
@back Pharmacy
Dorin: The pharmacy is eerily silent as we step inside, the faint light from the moon casting long shadows over the empty shelves and broken glass.
Dorin: Rows of empty pill bottles and discarded packaging litter the floor, telling the story of a place that was ransacked in the early days of the conflict. 
Dorin: Despite the overwhelming sense of despair, we both push on, knowing this is their last hope to find anything for Mira.

We both begin to search through the aisles, pushing aside debris and rummaging through what little remains.
The air is thick with dust, and the stench of decay fills the space. The few medical supplies they find are either spoiled or useless —— a stark reminder of how far the city has fallen.
I checked the labels on every bottle we find, but none are antibiotics. The situation grows more desperate by the minute.
