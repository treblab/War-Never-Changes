@back Sanctuary

As Ardan settles in with Mira and Naya, he replays the encounter with the other father, feeling the weight of his choices. Dorin’s voice echoes in his mind, reminding him of the values he was raised with—empathy, resilience, and a commitment to protect without sacrificing others. Ardan glances at his family and the other survivors, questioning the person he has become through the trials of war.

Mira: You did what you thought was right, Ardan. We’re here now… let’s make it count.

Ardan nods, though the doubt in his chest lingers. He catches Naya watching him, her young eyes filled with both pride and fear, and he realizes that his actions shape her understanding of the world. 

Looking around the sanctuary, he sees small cues that hint at deeper tensions — skeptical glances, a few murmurs, and the wary watch of a younger survivor. He knows that trust is fragile here.

As he continues to look around, the other father catches his gaze. For a moment, they share a silent, tense look. Then, with a reluctant nod, the other father turns away, subtly acknowledging the shared struggle they face.

Ardan looks down, his mind turning to his late father’s ideals. He realizes that to honor Dorin’s memory, he must rebuild trust from the ground up. He glances at Mira and Naya, a quiet determination filling him. Survival isn’t enough; he must find a way to earn their place here honorably.

He notices the inscription on the wall - “Trust is earned, not given” - and the words settle heavily in his mind. He reaches into his pocket, pulling out Dorin’s old compass, the one reminder he’s carried with him through every hardship. 

He sets it gently beside Naya as she sleeps, a silent vow to guide them forward with the values his father taught him.

As the family huddles together, a faint light from a nearby candle bathes their faces, casting shadows in the quiet. Ardan closes his eyes, resolved to face whatever lies ahead, knowing that his journey is far from over.
