As they navigate the crowded room, Ardan notices a familiar face across the sanctuary — the other father from the pharmacy, standing with his son nearby. The man’s eyes meet Ardan’s, a flicker of recognition crossing his face, quickly replaced by a guarded expression.

Ardan hesitates, glancing at Mira and Naya, uncertain whether to approach. Before he can decide, the community leader — a stern woman with watchful eyes—steps between them, addressing both men.

Leader: You two know each other?

The other father glances briefly at his son, then nods, his voice low but steady.

Man: Ran into each other over some antibiotics a while back. We… worked something out.

The community leader’s eyes narrow, assessing their tense exchange.

Leader: Well, if you’re both here, you know how things work. You contribute to stay, and you don’t bring in old grudges. Supplies are limited, so everyone pulls their weight. Got it?

Leader: The other father gives a reluctant nod, his gaze shifting from Ardan to Mira, who looks visibly weakened. After a beat, he speaks, his voice tinged with lingering suspicion.

Man: So… you got what you needed, then? Your mother… she’s still sick?

Ardan nods slowly, feeling a mix of gratitude and discomfort as he remembers the tense pharmacy encounter. He can see the other father’s son watching them, the boy’s eyes cautious yet curious.

Ardan: Yes, she’s… we’re managing. The antibiotics helped. Thank you.

Man: And your father? He’s not with you?

Ardan: My father… he’s gone. It’s just us now.

Man: I'm very sorry to hear that... I get it. Lost my wife early on. It’s just me and him now.

An awkward silence falls between them, the weight of shared loss hanging in the air. The community leader clears her throat, breaking the moment.

Leader: We’ve all lost someone. They would be happy knowing that you all survived.

Leader: That’s what we’re here for. To help each other survive. Now, we have a supply run tomorrow. We need all hands on deck. You two in?

Ardan and the other man nod.

She gestures for them to follow her to the main storage area, where she explains that a supply run is scheduled for the following morning. Resources are running low, and able-bodied residents are required to participate to keep the sanctuary stocked.

After the leader walks away, the other father turns to Ardan, a grudging respect in his eyes.

Man: I’ll be out there tomorrow. They say it’s rough — enemy patrols and… worse. Can’t afford to have anyone watching their back alone. Guess we could both use a partner. 

Ardan studies him, understanding the implication. The other father’s offer is practical; neither fully trusts the other, but both recognize the benefit of cooperation, especially in such dangerous times.

; Choices

CHOICE: The player must decide how Ardan responds to the offer of alliance, shaping the future of their relationship.

; Accept the Offer with Mutual Caution

Ardan: (with a nod) “I’ll watch your back if you watch mine. Let's keep things simple.”

Outcome: The other father agrees, and they join forces on the next supply run. During the mission, they build a tentative partnership, forged through shared survival but limited by mutual wariness. Ardan begins to sense a growing respect, though he knows full trust is a long way off.

; Refuse the Offer, Preferring Independence

Ardan: “I appreciate the offer, but I work better alone.”

Outcome: The other father shrugs, and they part ways. On the supply run, Ardan faces the hazards of the journey alone, narrowly escaping enemy patrols but with fewer resources to bring back. The other father, meanwhile, watches from a distance, and the tension between them lingers, casting doubt over future interactions.
